        <h2> Mt.Daguldul,Batanges</h2>

        <p> Mt. Daguldol is a coastal mountain located in the province of Batangas. It offers a scenic view of nearby Batangas mountains and beaches. Additionally, Mt. Daguldol has an elevation of 672 MASL or 2204 feet. Mt. Daguldol is exactly situated in Sitio Biga, Barangay, Hugom San Juan, Batangas. It is bound between the municipality of San Juan and Lobo. The Lobo municipality is also a highlands, with Mt. Naguiling being the tallest mountain.

The Tagalog word “Daguldol” means a feeling of apprehension and grandiosity. According to locals, the mountain was named as such because it describes the magnificence of the mountain range and the blunt rolling of its slopes. Mt. Daguldol has a total trail length of nine kilometers.
While scrolling, I saw someone posted on a Facebook group about the Mt. Daguldol day tour. I was amazed by the pictures because I never thought that the Philippines have this kind of mountain. It looks like it is located in another country. The organizer gave me the itinerary and I was happy to see that there’s a side trip going to the beach. I’ve never joined any day tour before that after hiking you will refresh on the beach. It is something that I look forward to and I want to experience it so I joined an organized tour.
